## UNRELEASED
- Add `--list-file` parameter to allow the user to specify a file from which to read
a list of files to count instead of using the normal directory walking method

## 0.3.4 (2016-11-04)
- Default to searching `.` if no target is specified (suggested by chris-morgan)
- F# support by red75prime
- Fixed counting bug for Lua and other languages where the multi-line start pattern has the single-line
  start pattern as a prefix (Lua single line comments start with `--`, multi with `--[[`)
  - Issue raised by jswrenn, great catch.
- Added tests for Lua, OCaml, Ruby, Ada.  Added a macro so the test file is much shorter despite
  the added tests.  I still feel there's probably a better way.
- Merged count_single, count_multi, count_single_multi into a single function.  The function
  is a bit more complicated, the code is also now much shorter.

## 0.3.3
- support for including only files that match a regex (can be combined with exclude) (suggested by alekratz)
- output is now 80 characters instead of 81 (gross) (issue raised by chneukirchen)
- fixed support for multiple targets (issue raised by horacekmi, great catch)
- zackshuster fixed compilation on windows by removing a broken dependency.
- cypressious added instructions for running under the windows linux sub-system
- pthariensflame synced the supported languages in the readme and also made it prettier
- gebner added Lean support
- AaronePower gave credit where it's due to Tokei and ripgrep.
- AlexanderThaller added saltstack support
- sunbubble added CUDA support
- Switched to MIT license

## 0.3.2 (2016-10-25)
- Add a license file.
- dignati added additional extensions for clojure (.cljs, .cljc)
- pthariensflame fixed the display names for a bunch of languages
- mclehmen fixed my broken wording in the readme
- little-dude added TCL support
- glennpratt fixed things so github correctly detects this as a Rust project

## 0.3.1 (2016-10-25)
There was no 0.3.1. You saw nothing.

## 0.3.0 (2016-10-24)

- @svenstaro added OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)

### Bugs
  - Fixed counting for python, which was extremely inaccurate due to an assumption that the
    start of comment character is different from the end of comment character, but we treat
    ''' as both starting and ending multiline comments for Python.
