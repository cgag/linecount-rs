`loc` is a tool for counting lines of code. It's a rust implementation of [cloc](http://cloc.sourceforge.net/), but it's more than 100x faster. There's another rust code counting tool called [tokei](https://github.com/Aaronepower/tokei), loc is ~2-10x faster than tokei, depending on how many files are being counted.

I can count my 400k file `src` directory (thanks npm) in just under 7 seconds with loc, in a 1m14s with tokei, and I'm not even willing to try with cloc.

Counting just the dragonflybsd codebase (~9 million lines):
  - loc: 1.09 seconds
  - tokei: 5.3 seconds
  - cloc: 1 minute, 50 seconds

### Installation

There are binaries available on the releases page, thanks to the wonderful rust-everywhere project and travisci. For anyone familiar with Rust there's `cargo install loc`.
If you want to install Rust/Cargo, this is probably the easiest way: [https://www.rustup.rs/](https://www.rustup.rs/).

### Known Issues
Fortran has a rule that comments must start with the first character of a line. I only check if it's the first non-whitespace character of a line. I don't know
how often this is a problem in real code.  I would think not often.

Comments inside string literals: You can get incorrect counts if your code has something like this:

```
x = "/* I haven't slept \ 
for 10 days \
because that would be too long \
*/";
```

loc counts the first line and last lines correctly as code, but the middle
lines will be incorrectly counted as comments.
